The `directed and flexible graph` is part of [DigiFors](https://digifors.de/) effort
to contribute to the analysing and detection of content and context dependent information.
'DFGraph' is a simple, but powerful graph based database library based on the `sqlalchemy` library.
Its main purpose is to store data from large datasets and allows manipulate, connect and detect content.
This allows for more flexible conversion and detection processes.  

## Installation

`pip install dfgraph`

## Usage

See the `examples/` files for some simple use-cases and implementations.

## Testing
till `pip 21.3`:
```
pip install --use-feature=in-tree-build -e .
```
`pip 21.3+`:
```
pip install -e .
```

```
coverage run --source=src -m pytest && coverage report -m
```

## Usage

`dfgraph` comes with two main classes: `Node` and `Relationship`.
It was designed to represent Data from Databases
